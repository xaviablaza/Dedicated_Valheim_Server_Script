```sh
sudo vi build_dedicated_valheim_server.sh

# There are 4 things you need to change!
# NOTE: Minimum password length is 5 characters
# NOTE: Unique password and server name is REQUIRED
# NOTE: NO $ ' " in the passwords - you will break the script 

userpassword='"user_password"'        <---password for the new Linux User it creates
